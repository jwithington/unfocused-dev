# Starting a New WordPress Blog With Digital Ocean

I launched this today and I did it with a few hours worth of work. Some considerations:

  * I&#8217;m actually super into [jekyll][1] and [static site generators][2] in general. However, I&#8217;m going to be helping with a project soon that might use WordPress, and I&#8217;m also pretty interested in it in general. So, here we go!
  * I&#8217;m comfy using tutorials for command line stuff.
  * I knew that WordPress administration includes worrying about security, especially with hosting my own cloud server.

Hey, so, GOOD NEWS! Digital Ocean has a bunch of related tutorials for this stuff.

So here are the steps I took to get to the point where I was writing this.

  1. Get a new droplet at [Digital Ocean][3]. This was easy because back in the day I used to run [Hard Like Algebra][4], using ghost, on a droplet. So hey, log in, [pick the one-click install][5], woot! I picked the cheapest one because I don&#8217;t anticipate having a ton of traffic right now, and I really see this as just giving it all a shot.
  2. I followed the instructions to set it all up.
  3. I then made sure to do all the security stuff that they recommended.
  4. And now I&#8217;m writing.

The thing is, something like this isn&#8217;t super tough if you&#8217;re willing to just _go for it_. I&#8217;m currently doing the [simple programmer][6] [free email course][7] on starting a blog, and I knew pretty early on that I didn&#8217;t want to use Bluehost because I didn&#8217;t want to commit to paying for a year upfront. Instead, here I am now, writing on my new cloud hosted blog. I even enabled https for the first time! Not too shabby.

Let me know if you have any issues with all of this, and happy blogging!
