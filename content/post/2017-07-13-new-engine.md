I decided to build (Un)focused Dev in WordPress, thinking that doing so would make me do a lot more WordPress dev.

I was wrong.

All it did was frustrate me, much like I thought it would. ðŸ˜†

So I'm back in Staticland, this time using [Netlify][netlify] and [Hugo][hugo].

I get to work using the JAMStack, a way of working I'm pretty stoked about.

Things around here are a bit broken right now, as I figure out silly things like "where'd my images go when I zapped them from Digital Ocean?"

All in good time.
