      <description>I decided to build (Un)focused Dev in WordPress, thinking that doing so would make me do a lot more WordPress dev.
I was wrong.
All it did was frustrate me, much like I thought it would. ðŸ˜†
So I&amp;rsquo;m back in Staticland, this time using Netlify and Hugo.
I get to work using the JAMStack, a way of working I&amp;rsquo;m pretty stoked about.
Things around here are a bit broken right now, as I figure out silly things like &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rsquo;d my images go when I zapped them from Digital Ocean?</description>
