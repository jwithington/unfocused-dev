      <description>I decided to build (Un)focused Dev in WordPress, thinking that doing so would make me do a lot more WordPress dev.
I was wrong.
All it did was frustrate me, much like I thought it would. ðŸ˜†
So I&amp;rsquo;m back in Staticland, this time using Netlify and Hugo.
I get to work using the JAMStack, a way of working I&amp;rsquo;m pretty stoked about.
Things around here are a bit broken right now, as I figure out silly things like &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rsquo;d my images go when I zapped them from Digital Ocean?</description>

      <description>For the first 5 weeks or so of 2017, I committed a whole lot to my #100DaysOfHealthing repo. The project buzzed around my head, I set up my work computer to launch Git Bash every day when I logged in, and folks that I admire even added me to their own projects.
And then hey look at that, it was February, and a lot of good things were happening in my personal life&amp;#8211;health things shaking out, finances slowly but kinda surely improving, meditating every day (not just three minutes at a time, but 10 minutes, even!</description>

      <description>100 Days of Healthing 
What&amp;#8217;s this, now? Inspired by 100DaysofCode, 100 Days of Healthing is a challenge to spend an hour a day, for 100 days, working on your health &amp;amp; self care. It&amp;#8217;s permission to give yourself an hour a day. And we&amp;#8217;re all here with you.
Why do you hate 100 Days of Code? Oh my goodness, that&amp;#8217;s so not true! I don&amp;#8217;t. I think it&amp;#8217;s a fabulous concept, super motivating, something I want to do (maybe for the second 100 days of 2017?</description>

      <description>Starting a New WordPress Blog With Digital Ocean I launched this today and I did it with a few hours worth of work. Some considerations:
 I&amp;#8217;m actually super into jekyll and static site generators in general. However, I&amp;#8217;m going to be helping with a project soon that might use WordPress, and I&amp;#8217;m also pretty interested in it in general. So, here we go! I&amp;#8217;m comfy using tutorials for command line stuff.</description>
